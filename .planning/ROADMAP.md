# Roadmap: OpenFacilitator Rewards Program

## Overview

This roadmap delivers a token rewards program where users earn $OPEN tokens for payment volume processed through OpenFacilitator. The journey starts with database foundation and auth integration, builds up address verification for both Solana and EVM chains, implements volume tracking and campaign systems, then delivers the claims flow with token distribution. With comprehensive depth (11 phases), each phase delivers a focused, verifiable capability that builds toward the complete rewards experience.

## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**
- Integer phases (1, 2, 3): Planned milestone work
- Decimal phases (2.1, 2.2): Urgent insertions (marked with INSERTED)

Decimal phases appear between their surrounding integers in numeric order.
